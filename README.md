# UFOs

## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage that will allow readers to parse data around UFO sightings. I have created the webpage in which the users will view the data (HTML). And the dynamic table that will present the data to the users (JavaScript).

##Results: 

The users can use the search criteria in many ways. One can enter the data, city, state, country and shape for the UFO Sighting.

For the Example I will be using the following data below:

Date : 1/5/2010

City: princeton

State: nj

Country: us

Shape: cigar

Once the user enters the appropriate information into the designated field the table will generate the results.


##Summary:

One drawback of the design I would say is the layout of the page it looks a bit crowded to me.

I would recommend that the summary would be in a box within itself and not right about the table. Center the title (UFO Sightings). Put the filter search options above the table and go with the light background or have an option where the reader can choose between light and dark background.
